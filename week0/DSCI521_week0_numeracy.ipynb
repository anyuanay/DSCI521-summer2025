        "There are no pre-requesites for this course but we will be getting off of the ground fast, and not only with programming _but_ calculation, too. Oftentimes, the programming necessary for calculation in data science is more straightforward/less ad hoc, and more abstractive in than it is for data pre-processing. We will often have to ask: \"What's the _appropriate_ model for this problem and what will its output mean?\" Even though we might not be 'solving for $x$' so regularly as in an algebra class, it's potentially just as important to be able to communicate using math language, as it will often serve as the instructions that tell us how to complete a calculation, i.e., reading math will be necessary for being able to execute an/or understand an algorithm found in some literature.\n",
        "\n",
        "So in the present course there will be only partial focus (but certainly not none!) usage of base programming. But when it comes to calculation, it's much easier to get _some_ output than the _right_ output. In other words, we'll be using some pretty powerful and (relatively) easy to use tools that make it very fast to get _an_ answer, i.e. without encountering any bugs or code errors. But there are new kinds of bugs that we have to worry abuot, i.e., the 'math', or, _how_ we execute our calculation. This means that a target in the course should be the development of intuition for calculation, and hence a need to be able to read and write math&mdash;numeracy&mdash;for the sake of communication. So, this additional section to our introduction now discusses the course's assumed mathematical proficiency in the context of the notation we'll be using, and the language and syntax necessary to express this mathematical notation&mdash;$\\LaTeX$ (pronounced 'lah-tek')."
