As we'll discuss in __Chapter 3__, the cosine (it can also be computed trigonometrically) similarity is a number derived from a pair of vectors that ranges over `[-1,1]`, which indicates how related they are: a value close to $0$ indicates little or no relationship exists, while values close to $1$ or $-1$ indicate when vectors positively (point along the same directions) or negatively (point along opposing directions) associate, respectively."

The important concept with eigenvectors that we want to discuss has to do with matrix-times vector multiplication. Recall: an $(m \\times n)$ matrix $A$ times an $(n \\times 1)$ vector $v$ results in another vector, having dimension $(m \\times 1)$. So what if $m = n$, i.e., the matrix $A$ is _square_? Well, then we could take the result and multiply it by $A$ again! This is one of the things that eigenvectors are all about:\n",
